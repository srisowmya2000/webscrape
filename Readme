WEB SCRAPING


It is the process of automation which allows you to gather information from the website. In this project, i will be using Python to develop a websraper and i will be using Beautiful Soup, requests,lxml libraries on Jupiter notebook. 
It is important to know that we use the same code for all the websites as they have different builds. We need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. 

There are other ways to scrape the websites such as Scrappy and Selenium.
